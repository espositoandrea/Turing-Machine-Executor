# A Turing Machine Executor (EMT)

A simple executor of _(almost)_ every Turing machine.

## The Name

`EMT` stands for _Esecutore di Macchine di Turing_, that is the Italian for _"Turing Machine Executor_.

## The Reasons

To be completely honest I was just really bored and I needed a way to spend my time while learning new languages.

## Known Bugs and Limitations

- [ ] This executor can only start right before the input string
- [ ] This executor is not much _user friendly_
